# moviedb_clone
A simple moviedb clone.

Using a guided video tutorial, I embarked on a project to create a moviedb clone, with a primary focus on enhancing my backend skills. I worked extensively with Spring Boot, MongoDB,  developing a simple backend infrastructure and a basic REST API with Java. Understanding the interactions between frontend and backend systems was my key objective. While I explored React for frontend development, it wasn't my central focus. I leveraged the Axios package to efficiently fetch movie data from an API I developed and displayed it in a straightforward UI. 

Given my emphasis on backend learning, some frontend features remained unfinished. Nonetheless, this experience provided valuable insights into data flow between frontend and backend, including storage and retrieval from MongoDB. The project was an invaluable full-stack learning experience.
